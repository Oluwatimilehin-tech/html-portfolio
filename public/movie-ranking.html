<h1>The Best Series According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 [The GOAT]</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>How can't you like a classic law show. Harvey and Mike are arguably the best characters</p>

<h3>The Lincoln Lawyer</h3>
<p>Mickey Hauler!!! Him and his crew are like the avengers in the court of law</p>

<h3>Lift</h3>
<p>Kev Hart was there</p>
